# Things to Do Before, During, and After Every Sprint

This project is iterated on with two-week sprints. During those two weeks, issues are created and tracked within GitHub. At the end of each sprint, these things should happen:

- The changelog should be updated with an overview of what happened during the sprint.
- A sentence detailing how many tickets of each kind completed during the sprint should be added to the changelog.
- A new section should be added to the changelog that sets up the upcoming sprint.
- The version number should be updated in the package.json file.
